  1. The first element within each `.main-section` should be a `header` element, which contains text that describes the topic of that section.
  1. Each `section` element with the class of `main-section` should also have an `id` that corresponds with the text of each `header` contained within it. Any spaces should be replaced with underscores.
  1. The `.main-section` elements should contain at least ten `p` elements total (not each).

  1. The navbar element should contain one `header` element which contains text that describes the topic of the technical documentation.
  1. Additionally, the navbar should contain link (`a`) elements with the class of `nav-link`. There should be one for every element with the class `main-section`.
  1. The header element in the `#navbar` must come before any link (`a`) elements in the navbar.
  1. Each element with the class of `nav-link` should contain text that corresponds to the `header` text within each `section`.
